# CSV-JSON Converter for Vega Radial Tree Layout




To install Python libraries, use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas
```

For `tkinter`, if it's not already installed, you can install it using your package manager. On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python-tk
```

Run Example:
```bash
python3 csvToJson.py
```

**Important Note:** _CSV file must be in <u>"Comma delimited UTF-8"</u> Format_


**Usage:**
You can view the graph by converting the created JSON file into an online link and making it the `data  > url`parameter in the [VEGA Editor](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/edited).
